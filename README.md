Google API Extensions for Ruby (gax-ruby) is a set of modules which aids the
development of APIs for clients and servers based on [gRPC][] and Google API
conventions.

Application code will rarely need to use most of the classes within this library
directly, but code generated automatically from the API definition files in
[Google APIs][] can use services such as page streaming and request bundling to
provide a more convenient and idiomatic API surface to callers.
